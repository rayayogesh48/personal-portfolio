# Content authoring

Create one Markdown file in `content/work`, `content/blog`, or `content/craft`. Its filename becomes the route slug. Use `status: draft` while editing and `status: published` when ready. Run `npm run content:check` before a build. The validator reports the filename and invalid field or missing local image.

Work entries require `title`, `summary`, `role`, `tags`, `kind: case-study | showcase`, `status`, and a story body when published. `timeline`, `featuredOrder`, `cover`, and `gallery` are optional. A positive `featuredOrder` includes the project on Home and orders it there. Images use `src`, `alt`, `width`, and `height`; paths start with `/images/` and point to files in `public/images`.

The work card uses `gallery` when it contains images, or `cover` as a single image. Add distinct, real project screenshots to `gallery` to enable the carousel. A single image shows no navigator. Do not duplicate a cover merely to display carousel controls.

The project story goes here.
```

Blog entries require `title`, `description`, a **quoted** `YYYY-MM-DD` publication `date`, `status`, and a body when published. `cover` and its `coverAlt` are optional together. Craft entries require `title`, `description`, `category` (`Product UI`, `Website Design`, or `Components`), `image` with dimensions and alt text, and `status`; `date` is optional. Craft has no published entries yet. Profile and experience remain typed records in `content/site`.

Do not place confidential draft artwork under `public/`: those files are directly reachable even when their content route is unpublished.
