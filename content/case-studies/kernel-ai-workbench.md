# Autonomous Agent Execution Mesh

## 1. Overview
- **Product:** Developer operations console for orchestrating, supervising, and verifying multi-agent automated coding tasks.
- **Audience:** Engineering leads and senior developers deploying autonomous background agents for codebase refactoring, security patching, and dependency upgrades.
- **Role:** Principal Product Engineer leading interface design and real-time streaming infrastructure.
- **Team & Timeline:** 2 engineers and 1 product designer over a 4-month build phase.

## 2. Problem
When autonomous agents run long multi-step workflows (reading repositories, editing files, running tests), users felt anxiety and lack of control:
- Terminal logs streamed hundreds of lines per second, making it nearly impossible to spot which files were being changed or where an agent had hallucinated.
- If an agent entered an infinite tool-calling loop, users had no quick way to pause, inspect the intermediate workspace diff, or course-correct without killing the entire session.
- Reviewing multiple concurrent agents required switching across separate terminal tabs, losing holistic context.

## 3. Evidence and Constraints
- **Interviews & dogfooding:** Engineers stated they did not trust agents to touch production code unless they could see a crystal-clear file diff before changes were committed.
- **Performance constraints:** The UI needed to handle streaming token feeds from up to 10 concurrent agents at 60fps without causing browser tab memory leaks or input lag.
- **Cognitive constraints:** Avoid excessive flashing widgets and graphs; information hierarchy had to stay quiet and actionable.

## 4. Decisions and Trade-offs
1. **Raw Terminal Stream vs. Semantic Execution Graph:**
   - Rather than dumping raw stdout text, we structured agent actions into semantic nodes (e.g., `Reading File`, `Editing AST`, `Running Tests`, `Error`).
2. **Batch vs. Real-Time Streaming Diffs:**
   - We implemented virtualized line-by-line diff viewing so users can review modifications as they happen, paired with an instant keyboard shortcut (`Space`) to pause agent execution.
3. **Single View vs. Multi-Tab:**
   - We used a split-pane layout: agent step hierarchy on the left, interactive diff and workspace terminal on the right.

## 5. Solution
- **Hierarchical Step Tree:** Collapsible execution timeline grouping sub-tasks with clear status badges and execution durations.
- **Interactive Inline Diff Preview:** Syntax-highlighted side-by-side diff showing exact line additions and deletions before disk persistence.
- **Intervention Controls:** Single-click buttons to approve step, send corrective human feedback into the agent context, or roll back uncommitted disk snapshots.

## 6. Outcome and Learnings
- **Delivered:** Deployed as the primary internal console for background refactoring agents across 40+ engineering repositories.
- **Verified impact:** Reduced average intervention and triage time from several minutes of terminal scrolling to under 30 seconds per task.
- **What remains to be validated:** Measuring whether junior engineers can confidently verify complex multi-file architectural refactors using the diff pane alone.
- **Future improvements:** Integrating automated AST semantic checks directly into the review drawer to highlight potential breaking API signatures before running test suites.
